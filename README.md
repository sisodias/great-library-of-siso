# The Great Library of SISO

A public, human-readable and agent-readable registry and learning system for SISO source.

**Live Library:** [great-library-of-siso.vercel.app](https://great-library-of-siso.vercel.app/)

> **Current scope:** The Agents section is the first deep vertical slice. Catalog presence is not a claim that source is downloadable, installable, portable, or licensed for reuse. See [License pending](LICENSE-PENDING.md).

## What the Library is

The Great Library of SISO is a catalog, not a giant monorepo. It gives people and agents a durable way to discover, understand, cite, and connect Works while their repositories, websites, owners, and locations can change.

The core model is deliberately small:

```text
Library
├── Sections                 browse projections
├── Works                    stable identities
├── Assemblies               versioned compositions of Works
└── Source Inventories       evidence-led staging before promotion to a Work

Distribution layers: Releases and Snapshots
Structure: typed relationships stored as data
```

- A **Section** is a browseable projection, not part of a Work's identity.
- A **Work** has a stable ID and a stable, human-readable Library detail URL.
- An **Assembly** keeps the components of a working stack together, records their contextual roles and dependencies, and can evolve by publishing a new immutable version.
- A **Source Inventory** maps valuable but mixed or unclassified material before it is safe to split, publish, archive, or promote into stable Works.
- A **Release** is an immutable manifest for a specific version and its evidenced distribution state.
- A **Snapshot** pins a named recursive view. A whole-Library snapshot is metadata-complete; payload materialization is separate and requires per-artifact receipts.
- A **relationship** is typed data. Directory nesting does not define global ownership, containment, or rank.

Every cataloged Work gets an always-on detail page in the hosted Library, even when its source repository has no website. A Work may also declare an optional upstream documentation or demo URL. This provides one public reading surface without requiring a separate deployment for every repository.

The generated **Promotion queue** exposes evidence-backed candidates from Source Inventories without presenting them as accepted Works. Its human page and machine JSON record ownership targets, portability, blockers, and exact next gates while raw laptop scans remain private.

Read the [registry model](docs/registry-model.md) for the identity and distribution boundaries.

New humans and agents should follow the [cold-start onboarding map](docs/onboarding.html) and the root [agent guide](AGENTS.md).

## First deep section: Agents

The first slice began with carefully reviewed seed records centered on:

- SISO Project OS
- SISO Agent Base
- Herdr
- Agent Zero

That foundation is preserved in immutable Assembly 1.0.0. **SISO Agent Stack 2.0.0** now records the complete public composition: Project OS, Runtime, Agent Zero, Skills, Playbook, Hooks, and optional Brain, Session Intelligence, Integrations, and Herdr. The separate Stack Distribution Work provides the one-clone installer; it does not absorb component identities. Skills remain reusable capabilities while playbooks compose them for scenarios.

Read the [SISO Agent Stack model](docs/agent-stack-model.html) for the corrected hierarchy and placement rules.

Inclusion means the Library describes the Work. It does not by itself promise a payload, installer, support relationship, or redistribution right. Herdr is an external upstream and must not be represented as SISO-owned. See the [verified V1 locator notes](docs/agents-v1.md).

## Research and Knowledge

Research is a separate browse section with independently addressable responsibilities: **SISO Knowledge** owns durable corpus and retrieval; **SISO Foundry** owns source discovery and reuse intelligence; **SISO Evidence Engines** own source-grounded transformation. Their repositories may be checked out together locally, but physical nesting does not imply containment. The [Foundry Agency Intelligence brief](docs/foundry-agency-intelligence.html) shows how source evidence is promoted through the Library and applied by SISO Agency OS without copying source products or private corpora into this repository.

Read the [SISO Knowledge model](docs/siso-knowledge-model.html) for the source-backed boundary, current migration state, data-plane rules, and repository split test.

The Research section now also hosts **Frontier Questions**—the public projection of the standing research portfolio historically called God Questions. Each question is a stable Work; each accepted answer is an immutable Release; Foundry buckets and other source scopes define the evidence universe without copying the warehouse into this repository. The generated **God Questions Observatory** exposes portfolio state and, when declared, the decision target, success criteria, falsifiers, evidence gaps, and watch triggers that make a question operational rather than merely documentary. Read the [Frontier Questions model](docs/research-question-model.html).

SISO's [public mission charter](docs/siso-mission.html) records the durable direction that Frontier Questions serve without redefining the Great Library as a company or operating engine. The [question-driven research architecture](docs/question-driven-research.html) connects books, repositories, people, datasets, operational evidence, assumptions, ADRs, experiments, and answer Releases; the [reusable Frontier Question template](docs/frontier-question-template.html) includes a worked CRM architecture example.

The [UNSOLVEABLE Mathematics Program](docs/unsolveable-mathematics-program.html) applies those contracts to open mathematics: exact problem identity, rewards, prior solution communities, formal statement fidelity, novelty review, proof certificates, independent replay, human scrutiny, portfolio selection, and phased AI-assisted campaigns. It starts as an authored Research constitution; selected problems become Frontier Question Works only after canonical-source and status review.

**Ecosystem Intelligence** adds the operational memory layer: immutable Events for intent, changes, ownership, evidence, and handoffs; machine-readable ADRs for architectural decisions; active branch/path reservations for concurrent agents; and an automatic Release/Snapshot changelog. Agents should read `site/intelligence.json`; humans can read the generated `/intelligence/` timeline. Read the [operating contract](docs/ecosystem-intelligence.html).

## What you can do

- **Browse** Sections and stable Work detail pages.
- **Add** a Work through a schema-valid, provenance-aware contribution.
- **Compose** a contextual view from typed relationships without redefining identity.
- **Research** decisions, evidence, releases, and related Works.
- **Review promotion candidates** without confusing discovery with release or distribution state.
- **Cite** a stable Work ID and, when relevant, a Release or Snapshot.
- **Correct** the source record instead of patching generated pages.
- **Contribute** clean public metadata, evidence, documentation, and tooling.

[Using the Library](docs/using-the-library.md) explains Work, Section, Release, and whole-snapshot retrieval.

## Repository map

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `registry/works/` | Current Work records |
| `registry/releases/` | Immutable Release Manifests |
| `registry/snapshots/` | Named pinned views |
| `registry/assemblies/` | Immutable versioned compositions of Works |
| `registry/source-inventories/` | Preservation-aware maps of mixed source awaiting promotion or reallocation |
| `schemas/` | Machine-readable contracts |
| `docs/` | Authored model, operating, and learning documentation |
| `site/` | Generated Pages artifact; do not hand-edit generated item pages |
| `scripts/` | Dependency-light validation and generation tooling |

The public `/promotion/` and `/promotion.json` surfaces are generated from accepted Source Inventories. See the [agent capability discovery and promotion program](docs/agent-capability-promotion.html).

The website, future CLI, and future MCP server must read these same contracts. There is no parallel hand-written registry.

## Verify locally

Use Node.js 20. The V1 gate validates records and schemas, builds `site/`, checks internal links, and scans the publication artifact for obvious secrets:

```bash
npm ci
npm run verify
```

Vercel is the primary static host and deploys only the generated `site/` directory. GitHub Pages remains an optional mirror. Neither host changes the registry identity or source-of-truth contracts.

```bash
npm run deploy:vercel
```

## Contributing and safety

Start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Never contribute credentials, private client source, personal notes, machine-specific paths, private topology, or raw operational databases. Report sensitive findings through [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), not a public issue.

No license has been selected for this repository. Public visibility is not general reuse permission; read [LICENSE-PENDING.md](LICENSE-PENDING.md) before copying or distributing repository material. External upstreams retain their ownership and licenses.
